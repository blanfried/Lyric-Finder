# Lyrics Finder

# Features Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bulma.

# Brief Description

For this project we were working as group of 5 and we were tasked with creating a real-world front-end application. We chose to create a lyric finder application that also features the top 10 songs as well as artist. We used 2 server side API's; lyrics.ovh to obtain data for the lyrics and last.fm to obtain the charts data.

# User Story

When the page is loaded you are able to view the interactive navbar which includes Sign up and Login options.
In the website you are able to search for an artist and song, the lyrics will be generated in the display box below the top 10 trending list of of artists/songs are displayed under this.
From the navbar you can chose to navigate to the home screen or recent searches where your recent searches are saved to the local storage.
